ALU operation encoding:

    000: mov
    001: add
    010: sub
    011: shr
    100: shl

instructions encoding:

    - Instructions are always 2 bytes long.

    these are the ways instructions can be decoded:
    where o: opcode, a: alu opcode, d: dest, n: immediate, s: source, a: adr register, r: register

    type 1:
    [oooo dddd ssss 0aaa]
    [oooo dddd nnnn 1aaa]
    type 2:
    [oooo rrrr aaaa nnnn]


    these are the different operation codes;

        0000: ALU       (type 1) ;   Perform ALU arithmetic on two registers.
        0001: LOAD      (type 2) ;   Loads a value from memory and puts it into a register.
        0010: STORE     (type 2) ;   Stores a value from a register into an address in memory.

    these are all of the instructions:

    [0000 dddd ssss 0000] mov d, s
    [0000 dddd ssss 0001] add d, s
    [0000 dddd ssss 0010] sub d, s
    [0000 dddd ssss 0011] shr d, s
    [0000 dddd ssss 0100] shl d, s

    [0000 dddd nnnn 1000] mov d, n
    [0000 dddd nnnn 1001] add d, n
    [0000 dddd nnnn 1010] sub d, n  
    [0000 dddd nnnn 1011] shr d, n
    [0000 dddd nnnn 1100] shl d, n
